<ul>
  <li><strong>Provide High-Quality Texts</strong> &mdash; We are
  committed to supporting as many languages as possible. To add support
  for a new language, all that is needed is a sufficient amount of text
    in the language with all special characters in place. Many of the
    currently-supported languages were trained with only a small amount
    of text—providing us with more will improve performance.</li>

  <li><strong>Share Feedback</strong> &mdash; An easy way to provide us
  with training text is directly through the Firefox add-on. If
  Accentuate.us makes an error, correct the error, highlight the text,
  right click, and choose "Submit Selection as Feedback...". Or, submit
  any text at all, as long as you’re confident that the special
  characters are correct—more is better!</li>

  <li><strong>Improve Dictionaries</strong> &mdash; In addition to the
  statistics gathered from training texts, Accentuate.us relies upon open
  source spell checking dictionaries when restoring texts. Unfortunately,
  less than 60% of our supported languages have open source spell
  checkers, and some of these have poor coverage. Help us develop new
  word lists, and improve the ones that exist.</li>

  <li><strong>Translate the Interface</strong> &mdash; Because our
  mission is to serve language communities around the world, we’ve taken
  care to ensure all of our software is fully translatable. Contact us if
  you’d like to translate Accentuate.us into your language. We host
  translations on transifex.net.</li>

  <li><strong>Host a Server</strong> &mdash; We are hosting over 100
  languages on a small number of servers and response times can
  occasionally be slow because of this. We can provide better service to
  your language community if you’d be willing to run an instance of the
  Accentuate.us server in your home country. Please contact us to make
  arrangements.</li>

  <li><strong>Donate or Sponsor</strong> &mdash; Although Accentuate.us
  is free and open source software, it takes money to run. In order to
  help us better support our large collection of languages and continue
  to enhance user experience, you can donate.</li>
