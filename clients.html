<h1 id="clients">Enhanced with Accentuate.us</h1>

<h2 id="firefox">Firefox</h2>
<p>The Accentuate.us Firefox add-on allows you to type quickly and easily in more than 100 languages without extra keystrokes or a special keyboard. It works anywhere on the web: in your blog, web mail, social networking sites, or in online editors like Google Docs.</p
<p><strong><a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/accentuateus/" target="_blank">Install the Firefox add-on</a></strong></p>

<h2 id="vim">Vim</h2>
<p>Vim is a powerful text editor favored by many software developers (including us at Accentuate.us). Vim master Bill Odom of the <a href="http://vimgeeks.org/" target="_blank">Vim Geeks</a> group made it easy to use Accentuate.us from within vim:</p>
<p><strong>Download the <a href="http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=3518" target="_blank">vim plugin</a>, install either the <a href="/accentuateus-site/clients.html">Perl or Python client</a>, and follow the documentation.</strong></p>
