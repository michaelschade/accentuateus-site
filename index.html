<ul>
  <li><strong>Type Faster</strong> &mdash; Even if keyboard input is
  possible for your language, it may be slow or cumbersome to type
  special characters.</li>
  <li><strong>Type Anywhere</strong> &mdash; If there is no keyboard for
  your language, or you are forced to use one not set up to type your
  language, then Accentuate.us is for you.</li>
  <li><strong>Type Anything</strong> &mdash; If you are learning
  a language, or your language uses a complicated writing system, you may
  not always know when to use special characters.</li>
</ul>

<p>Accentuate.us uses statistics to predict where special characters
belong in each language. It will make mistakes, sometimes frequently, so
please proofread the results carefully.  We recommend against using the
program for tattoos, gravestones, or other important texts.</p>
