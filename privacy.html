<p>The Firefox add-on communicates with our servers in three ways: (1)
upon initialization, to get the list of available languages, (2) whenever
you restore a text, and (3) when you choose to provide feedback. In all
three cases, we store basic information about your connection that does
not reference an individually identifiable user: the IP address and
a UserAgent string which contains the version of your browser and the
version of the add-on.</p>

<p>When restoring a text or providing feedback, we also log the requested
language in order to evaluate the demand for different languages and help
serve you better.</p>

<p>When you restore a text using Accentuate.us, neither the original text
nor the corrected text are stored on our servers.</p>

<p>The only time we will store your text on our servers is when you
explicitly provide the text to us as feedback. Feedback is never
activated by default; you must opt-in every time and you select the text
that is sent. We store the text you highlight, together with the words
preceding and following the highlighted text, for statistical
purposes.</p>

<p>Firefox will periodically check the Mozilla Add-ons site for updates.
This is only to give you the latest security and bug fixes.</p>
